                                 <p>Before delving into the first activity of my engineering career, I must say that this was perhaps the best way I could have possibly started in my introduction to design thinking methodology. I was immediately captivated by this new way of thinking which I had never encountered prior to this experience. 
Overall, design thinking methodology can be summarized by 6 words: empathize, design, ideate, prototype, test, and implement. In completing this first activity, I was able to experience, hands-on, what is like to actively implement this process to the engineering process. 
So exactly what did we do in our first activity? Well we built chairs of course! Together my partners and I began by considering the needs of our first “customer”, Bart Simpson. Like most students have felt at one point or the other in their academic career, Bart was feeling a bit sore from having to sit in an uncomfortable chair for hours on end as he listened to his class lecture. Being students ourselves, we immediately felt for Bart and his struggle to maintain focus in such an uncomfortable chair! We thought: what are those things about this chair that are likely annoying him? Perhaps it’s too stiff. Or maybe there is nowhere to put his bookbag… This led us immediately into our second step which was defining those things that could use an improvement. Soon followed ideation, where we drew out and documented our various ideas, then organized them by necessity, and implementability. Next was the fun part – building a prototype! We built our first prototype out of entirely pipe cleaners, therefore encouraging creativity as we navigated through our material restraints. Our second prototype,was made out of cardboard, and it did not necessarily do as planned when as we put it through not-so-rigorous testing. We found that despite being our second iteration of chair, it was not as structurally sound as our first prototype, and that’s okay!! We learned that the design process is not always a linear climb towards improvement. Sometimes we face difficulties and we learn what works and what doesn’t. We hope to learn enough from this engineering course, that we can begin to implement and put our visions into realities.

                        <p>In constructing the Prusa mini, it took a little while to gain an understanding of how the manual presented the instruction material. Some things that confused me at first included the colored bullet points and which parts they were asking for from step-to-step. Although there were names to the parts, the naming scheme felt unintuitive and confusing. We ended up using the size chart more than anything else in the process of constructing the Prusa Mini. Additionally, when it came to really confusing parts of the manual, my partner and I just had to use our intuition as to where a particular part went in the construction. Overall, the experience was frustrating, but we at the end we felt quite accomplished.

                        <p>After downloading the official STL file for the Benchy torture test boat, we opened it in PrusaSlicer and ensured that the print settings were set to the appropriate model 3D printer. I was then able to proceed to save the file onto a hard drive then plug it into an available 3D printer. This is where my partner and I began to run into problems! Unfortunately, in our attempt to calibrate the nozzle height, we put it too low and during the calibration test, the 3D printer laid down the PLA way too close to the heated plate. Unfortunately, this meant we had to use a very dangerous and sharp scraper (with permission from the instructor of course!). After calibrating our settings to an appropriate height, we we able to print our first benchy model, which came out looking fantastic!</p>

This time around, I attempted to print a 3D Benchy boat as fast as possible. When exporting the finished product to the harddrive, I neglected to change the material settings in Prusa Slicer to the PLA, in addition to changing the settings to match the correct 3D printer. Luckily I caught this mistake before printing, although I did have to redo all my settings (how annoying..!). Overall, the print was completed in 34 minutes with no major issues. In comparison to the 1st Benchy boat, this print was definitely more flimsy, but overall the structural integrity of the boat was sound and has held up inside the treacherous environment that is the inside of my backpack! All in all, I am very happy with this print.</p>

                        <p>Before we move on to our next large endeavor, our class wanted to once again ensure that the parameters set up on Prusa Slicer were in a sound configuration before moving on to a much larger and time consuming print. We tried to keep our prints to about an hour which meant that most of our prints were relatively small. I chose to print out a mini “Kirby pencil holder” which took an hour and fourteen minutes to complete. Overall, this print came out looking pretty fantastic! Admittedly, it is too small to be a pencil holder, but the print is structurally sound and durable. The image below shows some of the support that was removed during post-processing. </p>
